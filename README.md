## Guide to React

npm-start == start project and run before coding!

package.json = dependencies and scripts

node_modeles = all dependencies like virtualenv

public
    index.html = our page // <div id = root> is important
    beacuse react is mounted there
src
    index.js = refers 'root' in index.html above!

Component
    should render & return some HTML to DOM!
    should contain one root element each!
